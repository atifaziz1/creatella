# Ad's
I didn't implement ad's in this project.I am presenting my logic.
In Mobile application , ad's shows at bottom of the screen.After some time chagne the ad's.
If you want to implement ad's without using third party then make a View on footer and show ad's in Image tag, and dynamically change the url of image for some specific period of time.

# React JS

Make GridView Component using React Fragment and add Material UI Grid.
Pass data with props in component.

Other logic and redux is same as React Native.

Here we use different techiques to show ad's.
